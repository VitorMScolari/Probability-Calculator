# Probability-Calculator
Free Code Camp Scientific Computing challenge

This is the solution for the Probability Calculator challenge on free code camp in the section "Scientific Computing with Python"

I tried solving on my own and nothing was working, so I decided to look at other people solution,
I ran Faraday´s Academy solution on my replit and it didn´t seem to work because there was an error, on her video it seemed to work just fine but for some reason on my replit it was working, so I used python tutor to understand what was the mistake with my code and then I´ve figured out how fix it and this is the solution...
